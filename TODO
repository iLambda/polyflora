# TODO (order of importance)

-> Leaves

-> All bend modes can be summed up into two parameters
    -> Initial bend (only affects i=0 (up, down mode)) & Cumulative bend
        -> At joint i, the angle is α_i = α_init + (i * α_cumul) 
-> Add distribution modes to branches
    -> Opposite, stair, pair, twisted pair
-> Allow cross geometry to have middle seam
    -> Parametrize seam angle

-> Subbranches

-> Save/load from JSON
-> Export vertex painted model

-> Multiple tree-generating models. When creating new file, ask for model
    -> Currently using tree[d] generation algorithm
    -> Scripting language to generate it ?

-> 2D render mode
    -> Serializes camera position for further renders
    -> Can toggle show/hide branches in render by clicking on them

# Look up into

-> Flower & shrubs generation
    -> Look into TheGameCreators - Plant Life
        - https://archive.org/details/plant-life-10501

-> Curve mode for trunk shape ?
-> Modify individual branches.
    -> This locks the seed, and only unlocks it if user is willing to throw away all its changes

-> Multiple trunks
